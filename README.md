# Derivora Util Kit

## About the Project

Derivora Util Kit is a module designed to implement fundamental programming utilities in Java. This module is part of the derivora project and provides a collection of reusable tools and helper classes for various applications.

The project has started active development. Currently, it includes core validation utilities, such as ValidationException, ValidationUtil, and Validator.

## Objectives of the Module

* Improve development efficiency: Offer ready-made solutions for common programming tasks.
* Versatility: Create tools suitable for a wide range of use cases.
* Lightweight and efficient: Minimize overhead when using the utilities.

## Project Structure

* Package `xyz.derivora.utilkit.arrays offers` utilities for performing common array operations, such as merging arrays with type safety and determining common component types.
* Package `xyz.derivora.utilkit.validation` provides essential tools for implementing validation logic across the application.
